# Alzheimer-s-disease-prediction-using-deep-learning

Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible,  progressive brain disorder that slowly
destroys memory and thinking skills and,  eventually, the ability to carry out the
simplest tasks.

We used multiple models to detect Alzheimer’s disease from scans and text data.
